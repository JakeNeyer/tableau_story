## Synopsis
During its maiden voyage, disaster struck the RMS Titanic. On April 15, 1912 the ship collided with an iceberg in the Northern Atlantic Ocean. According to the estimates, there were 2,224 passengers and crew aboard the vessel. Of those 2,224 individuals more than 1,500 died. My goal is to better understand which factors led to the survival or death of the people involved in this historic tragedy.

## Design
I tried to illuminate the chances of survival based on socio-economic status, gender, and age. Throughout the visualizations, I chose to represent death in a red color and life in a black color to provide high contrast yet an easy viewing experience. I attempted to make the visualizations as interactive as possible to create a platform that allows intuition to thrive. However at the same time, I attempted to keep the visualizations as minimal as possible so that the viewer would not be overwhelmed with unimportant legends and axis titles. For example, I removed all titles from the age distrubtion histogram and simply added an annotation to describe the graph. With that being said, I left necessary axis title such as those in the text table.

The listing of each individual provides a good illustration of the survivors and non-survivors. Additionally, I chose to use text tables to display the percentage breakdown of survival based on gender and passenger class. And finally, I decided to incorporate the age distribution histogram to provide some more detailed insight to the chance of survival.

After receiving feedback, I added totals to the page with each individual graphically listed. I also added another page to the story which textually displays each individual and the age and socio-economic class they belong to. I also added more description to the text boxes. 

## Feedback

Some criticisms of my project were as follows:

- Provide a more illuminated end result. Why is the data important?
- Include a total count of the those who lived and died on the second page.
- Describe the final findings.
